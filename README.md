# Mintlify Themes

## What Themes are

No one wants their documentation to look like everyone else's. Themes enables you to transform the styling and layout of your documentation to fit your branding.

Ever wanted your documentation to look like that of your favorite companies? With Themes, you can achieve this with just one line of code.

This repository includes a set of three themes: [Quill](https://starter-quill.mintlify.app/), [Prism](https://starter-prism.mintlify.app/), and [Venus](https://starter-venus.mintlify.app/), with many more coming in the following months.

### Quill ‚Äî the minimalist theme

**[Quill](https://starter-quill.mintlify.app/) is built for simple and modern brands.**

With its clean lines, sharp edges, and an uncluttered look, Quill allows your content to take center stage, ensuring that your audience is focused on what's most important.


### Prism ‚Äî the gradient theme

**[Prism](https://starter-prism.mintlify.app/) brings vibrant colors to your documentation with a gradient touch.**

It's perfect for companies that want to make a bold statement and stand out from the crowd.

### Venus ‚Äî the utility theme

**[Venus](https://starter-venus.mintlify.app/) is designed for API and SDK heavy products with extensive functionality and content.** 

Its design is focused on usability, making it easy for your audience to navigate through content.
