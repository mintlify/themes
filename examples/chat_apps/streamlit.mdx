- **Chat history**: The application maintains a persistent chat history, allowing users to see the full context of their conversation.
- **Simple and intuitive interface**: The app uses Streamlit's straightforward UI elements, making it easy to input messages and view responses.

- Python 3.8+
- A valid CentML API key (to be set as an environment variable `CENTML_API_KEY`)
