## Space That Improves Readability

The theme uses grand, expansive layouts that give content room to breathe. Long API references become easier to scan, visual fatigue is reduced, and readers can move through complex sections without losing context, even during extended reading sessions.

**Clear Structure at Every Level.** Sequoia emphasizes strong hierarchy and organization. Headings, navigation, and content sections guide users naturally through dense material, making it well suited for enterprise APIs where developers frequently jump between guides, concepts, and detailed references.

**Designed for Serious Documentation.** This theme works especially well for public APIs, infrastructure tools, and documentation-first products. It delivers a professional, premium feel without unnecessary decoration.
